            <p>I am a finish carpenter and bartender residing in Park City, Utah. I was born and raised in New Jersey, where I attended Rutgers University, graduating with a BA in Economics and Political Science in 2013. I moved to Utah in December of 2016 following a summer in Jackson Hole, WY, where I lived and worked in Grand Teton National Park food and beverage. With tupleo, I have the opprotunity to enter several cocktail competitions, and have won several awards.</p>  
            <p>During my free time, I enjoy running, skiing, mountain biking, mountaineering, and playing with my two year old dog, Wilson.</p>
            <p>In the past, I have attempted to learn to code on my own. Life tends to get in the way of my successes in that regard, having attempted two coursera courses and a codecademy ready program.</p>
